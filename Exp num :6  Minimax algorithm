Date:			                   MINIMAX  ALGORITHM
Ex. No: 6
AIM:

To write a python program to implement Min-Max Algorithm.



ALGORITHM:

STEP 1: Start the program

STEP 2: Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.

STEP 3: It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc.

STEP 4: In Minimax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer.

STEP 5: Maximizer goes LEFT: It is now the minimizers turn. The minimizer now has a choice between 3 and 5. Being the minimizer it will choose the least among both, that is 3

STEP 6: Maximizer goes RIGHT: It is now the minimizers turn. The minimizer now has a choice between 2 and 9. He will choose 2 as it is the least among the two values.

STEP 7: Being the maximizer, you would choose the larger value

STEP 8: Compile and execute the program.

STEP 9: Print the result.

STEP 10: End.

PROGRAM:
# A simple Python3 program to find
# maximum score that
# maximizing player can get
import math
def minimax (curDepth, nodeIndex,
             maxTurn, scores,
             targetDepth):
 
    # base case : targetDepth reached
    if (curDepth == targetDepth):
        return scores[nodeIndex]
     
    if (maxTurn):
        return max(minimax(curDepth + 1, nodeIndex * 2,
                    False, scores, targetDepth),
                   minimax(curDepth + 1, nodeIndex * 2 + 1,
                    False, scores, targetDepth))
     
    else:
        return min(minimax(curDepth + 1, nodeIndex * 2,
                     True, scores, targetDepth),
                   minimax(curDepth + 1, nodeIndex * 2 + 1,
                     True, scores, targetDepth))
     
# Driver code
scores = [3, 5, 2, 9, 12, 5, 23, 23]
 
treeDepth = math.log(len(scores), 2)
 
print("The optimal value is : ", end = "")
print(minimax(0, 0, True, scores, treeDepth))

OUTPUT:





RESULT: Therefore, the above program to implement Min-Max Algorithm is compiled and executed successfully.
