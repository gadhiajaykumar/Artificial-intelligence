B).GCD OF TWO NUMBERS 
AIM:

To write a prolog program to implement GCD of Two numbers.

ALGORITHM:

STEP 1: Start the program. Get input for the two numbers
STEP 2: Declare the facts and rules for GCD of two numbers.

STEP 3: Perform suitable operations.
STEP 4: Post Queries related to the given problem in the Query box.

STEP 5: Compile and execute the program.

STEP 6: Get the answers for the queries asked and print the result.

STEP 7: End

PROGRAM:

gcd(X,Y):-X=Y,write('GCD of two numbers is '),write(X);
X=0,write('GCD of two numbers is '),write(Y);
Y=0,write('GCD of two numbers is '),write(X);
Y>X,Y1 is Y-X,gcd(X,Y1);
X>Y,Y1 is X-Y,gcd(Y1,Y).
