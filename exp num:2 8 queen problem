Ex. No: 2

AIM:

To write a python program to implement 8(eight) Queen problem.

ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Start the program.
STEP 2: Start by placing the first queen on the top-left square of the chessboard.
STEP 3: If we have placed the 8 queens, we’re done. Otherwise, is it possible to place a another queen in a safe position?
STEP 4: If yes, then mark this [row, column] as part of the solution, and go back to point 3. 
STEP 5: If no, then change the position of the previous queen (backtracking) and go back to point 3.
STEP 6: Compile and execute the program.
STEP 7: Print the result.
STEP 8: End
