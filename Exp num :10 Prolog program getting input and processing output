A).PROCESSING NUMBERS: CALCULATING FACTORIAL
AIM:
To write a prolog program to implement Factorial.


ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Start the program

 STEP 2: Enter the integer as X.

 STEP 3: Initialize A=1
  
STEP 4: If X=0, then print Factorial of A.

STEP 5: If X! =0, (ie) =B, then perform Factorial of B and print the result.

STEP 6: End.

PROGRAM:

fact(0,1).
fact(N,F) :-
(   % the below is for +ve factorial N > 0->
(   N1 is N - 1,
fact(N1,F1),
F is N*F1);
% The below is for -ve factorial
N<0->  (   N1 is N+1,fact(N1,F1),F is N*F1)).
